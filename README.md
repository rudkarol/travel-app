A mobile travel planning application for iOS 18. The app allows users to browse attractions and create travel plans. It features a backend built with Python FastAPI and MongoDB Atlas, integrates external data sources ([Tripadvisor API](https://tripadvisor-content-api.readme.io/reference/overview), [Travel.State.Gov](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html), [Meteostat](https://dev.meteostat.net/python/)), and uses OpenAI's GPT-4o mini AI model to automatically generate travel itineraries. The application uses [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs) for secure user authentication and authorization
